        There are three main tools that make up how websites are structured and transferred – those being HyperText 
        Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets, and JavaScript. HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is perhaps the 
        most foundational element of webpage and digital design – making up the text and image content of the webpage, 
        classifying them by elements, classes, and identifiers, and laying out their general structure for the page. 
        Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is then the tool that takes html content and styles it by its classifications 
        – responsible for more stylistic choices such as font, spacing, and color, as well as key elements including 
        positioning, sizing, and general layout. JavaScript is the last tool that often comes paired in the trio, 
        enabling more interactive elements of a webpage through direct function calls, event listeners and clever 
        scripting. If we were to think of a webpage as a container for information much akin to a physical cupboard or 
        dresser, then HTML would comprise the drawers and contents, while CSS captures properties such as color, 
        sizing, ornamentation, and layout. Lastly, JavaScript would make up the more interactive elements of the 
        dresser not quite embodied by the previous two, including how it opens, if it locks, and perhaps if there are 
        other user features. Although alternatives and upgrades have been created for each tool in the time since their 
        inception, this phase of the practicum primarily focuses on how to create a webpage from scratch using 
        foundational HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. As part of a three-webpage series, each webpage showcases and 
        highlights a specific tool of the trio, demonstrating their strengths and use cases while getting in some 
        practice. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For this example, I created a simple album carousel webpage to demonstrate the potential and effect of 
        JavaScript support. As mentioned previously, JavaScript is primarily used today to add a certain flair or 
        interactivity to a webpage that cannot otherwise be captured by HTML or CSS.  Though JavaScript as a language 
        can exist in many forms, basic JavaScript in webpages is typically structured as a collection of functions or 
        event listeners that execute upon user interaction, such as a mouse click or hover. To pull specific objects 
        for function calls and editing, JavaScript uses method calls similar to CSS selectors, taking in classes and 
        identifiers as parameters. In doing so, JavaScript can edit the style, contents, and even metadata of pulled 
        elements, scripting them to change with interaction from the user or even each other. While JavaScript is 
        probably the least necessary tool of the common trio, its versatility as a scripting language adds a new 
        potential for how websites can interact with its users, adding a flair unique to the digital platform. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This webpage attempts to capture the interactivity of JavaScript by creating an album carousel, complete with 
        interactive cards that dip with the mouse and either rotate or turn around with a click. The interactive cards 
        are achieved with 3 event listeners for each card, activating when the mouse moves onto a card, continues to be 
        on a card, and exits a card. In doing so, the event listeners then collect the X,Y positioning of the mouse, 
        attenuate it according to the width of the card, and apply it to the rotation of the card, creating an animated
        effect. Using a wrapper with a static field indicating which card is in the center, only one card is activated 
        at a time, letting the user interact with just the center. Meanwhile, the other two cards are associated with a 
        function that rotates the whole carousel by one, updating each HTML object with a new class and incrementing 
        the static field. Together, these systems create an album carousel that uses the basic tools of JavaScript to 
        interact with the user that otherwise wouldn’t have been possible.
