        There are three main tools that make up how websites are structured and transferred – those being HyperText 
        Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets, and JavaScript. HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is perhaps the 
        most foundational element of webpage and digital design – making up the text and image content of the webpage,
        classifying them by elements, classes, and identifiers, and laying out their general structure for the page. 
        Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is then the tool that takes html content and styles it by its classifications –
        responsible for more stylistic choices such as font, spacing, and color, as well as key elements including 
        positioning, sizing, and general layout. JavaScript is the last tool that often comes paired in the trio, 
        enabling more interactive elements of a webpage through direct function calls, event listeners and clever 
        scripting. If we were to think of a webpage as a container for information much akin to a physical cupboard or 
        dresser, then HTML would comprise the drawers and contents, while CSS captures properties such as color, 
        sizing, ornamentation, and layout. Lastly, JavaScript would make up the more interactive elements of the 
        dresser not quite embodied by the previous two, including how it opens, if it locks, and perhaps if there are 
        other user features. Although alternatives and upgrades have been created for each tool in the time since their 
        inception, this phase of the practicum primarily focuses on how to create a webpage from scratch using 
        foundational HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. As part of a three-webpage series, each webpage showcases and 
        highlights a specific tool of the trio, demonstrating their strengths and use cases while getting in some 
        practice. 
        <br>
        For this example, I created a simple resume webpage to demonstrate the usage and properties of CSS. As 
        mentioned previously, CSS primarily focuses on the styling and layout of a webpage, modifying existing HTML 
        content via property declarations. Using HTML’s system of identifying elements, classes, and identifiers, CSS 
        is primarily structured as a list of selectors that each pull out and style certain objects within a HTML page.
        In doing so, selectors can not only pull out specific objects, but also the objects neighbor, descending, and 
        ascending from them in nested sequence – as well as objects undergoing specific states such as a mouse hover or
        click. Each selector can set then properties that change the look and layout of the elements, with declarations
        ranging from general size and color to positioning and spacing. In doing so, entire webpages can be laid out in
        methods unique to the digital platform, with navbars that move with your scrolling, buttons that become 
        recessed with a mouse hover, and moving objects across the page.
        <br>
        This webpage attempts to capture the importance and freedom of CSS by emulating a resume site under three 
        different stylesheets. As demonstrated by different the cards located on the bottom, the main elements of the
        website – those being the image carousel, the cards, and especially the navbar – all change in design and 
        layout as different stylesheets take center stage. The first stylesheet, as shown by card 1, uses a dark navy 
        layout which places the navbar between the image carousel and cards, but sticks to the top of the page as a 
        user scrolls down. The second stylesheet, as shown by card 2, uses a bold orange layout which places the navbar 
        vertically on the side of the screen aside the other two objects. The third stylesheet, as shown by card 3, 
        uses a vibrant green layout with places the navbar at the top of the webpage always, such that it always comes 
        first. By changing the design and layout of objects as simple as the navbar, the aesthetic of the webpage can 
        shift dramatically with each different stylesheet. While CSS doesn’t change the content of a webpage, it can 
        order and style it to improve its flow and delivery.
