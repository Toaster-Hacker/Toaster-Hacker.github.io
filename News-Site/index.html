                                There are three main tools that make up how websites are structured and transferred –
                                those being HyperText Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets, and JavaScript. 
                                HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is perhaps the most foundational element of 
                                webpage and digital design – making up the text and image content of the webpage, 
                                classifying them by elements, classes, and identifiers, and laying out their general 
                                structure for the page. Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is then the tool that takes 
                                html content and styles it by its classifications – responsible for more stylistic 
                                choices such as font, spacing, and color, as well as key elements including 
                                positioning, sizing, and general layout. JavaScript is the last tool that often comes
                                paired in the trio, enabling more interactive elements of a webpage through direct 
                                function calls, event listeners and clever scripting. If we were to think of a webpage
                                as a container for information much akin to a physical cupboard or dresser, then HTML
                                would comprise the drawers and contents, while CSS captures properties such as color,
                                sizing, ornamentation, and layout. Lastly, JavaScript would make up the more 
                                interactive elements of the dresser not quite embodied by the previous two, including 
                                how it opens, if it locks, and perhaps if there are other user features. Although 
                                alternatives and upgrades have been created for each tool in the time since their 
                                inception, this phase of the practicum primarily focuses on how to create a webpage 
                                from scratch using foundational HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. As part of a three-webpage 
                                series, each webpage showcases and highlights a specific tool of the trio, 
                                demonstrating their strengths and use cases while getting in some practice. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                For this example, I created a news-site webpage to demonstrate the usage and structure 
                                of HTML. As mentioned previously, HTML primarily encapsulates much of the textual and 
                                image content of a webpage, but also captures important information such as metadata, 
                                links, and text formatting. In doing so, HTML structures information in distinct 
                                elements, nesting them as necessary to produce a layered effect of data and styles. 
                                While many elements are general and can functionally be swapped interchangeably, others
                                may have specific features embedded within them, such as links, images, lists, or 
                                scripts. As well, elements and their contents can be further divided into classes and 
                                identifiers for further specialization, which are often used in CSS and JavaScript to 
                                reference subsets or specific elements. While identifiers tend to be specific, - 
                                unique to a single element in a document – classes are more general, with the ability 
                                to be shared between multiple elements and for elements to have multiple classes. 
                                Together, classification by proper elements, classes, and identifiers doesn’t just 
                                signal to a viewer how information should be grouped but allows other tools to better 
                                integrate with the content as well. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This webpage attempts to capture the spirit of HTML by utilizing and nesting separate 
                                elements together to create three main sections of the ‘news-site’ – those being the 
                                upper navbar for the sites’ title and general information, the side navbar for the 
                                sites’ current stories divided by region, and the main body where one may find this 
                                passage as well as other example articles. By looking at the contents of the 
                                ‘index.html’ file, one may find that each of these sections comprise different but 
                                important elements and classes. The upper navbar, for instance, uses the &ltnav&gt element
                                to contain its contents, which each section within it being nested &ltdiv&gt elements of 
                                different classes. In contrast, the sidebar uses a custom &ltdiv&gt and ‘.side-bar’ class 
                                to separate its style from the previous section, and instead orders its contents as a
                                list of links to articles. Lastly, the main body comprises a list of articles by 
                                creating sequential &ltdiv&gt elements with the ‘.card’ class, each containing more nested
                                elements with the article’s region, photo, and title. Together, these create a simple 
                                news-site with an intuitive UI and uses common classes within its structure to 
                                highlight how the HTML content itself is used and structured.
